# About my journey learning C

Learning C is not related to my education in Games Programming at SAE Institute.  
However, due to my enjoyment for coding and my desire to improve my flexibility for potential job applications I decided to get to know another language in my spare time.
I decided to go with C because of its low level nature and relationship to C++, which is relevant for working on many relevant game engines like Unreal.

## Projects in this Depository
This Depository contains the various projects I build to learn C, starting with simple console programs I plan to get into more and more complex projects in time.


## 1. Console Input and Sort Algorithm Project
A console project that takes an integer array as user Input and uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in a rising order.

## 2. Console Quiz
A console project that lets the user choose between different options, using the arrow buttons to navigate through the selection.
